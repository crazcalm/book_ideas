# Poker hand
## Sorting the Poker Hand

Now we have a method to determine our poker hand type, we can now sort our poker hands! Let's start off by creating on outline of this method.

```rust,noplayground
    fn sort_hand(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
        let _ = self.set_hand_type()?;
        let card_rank_histogram = self.card_rank_histogram();

        let poker_hand_type = self.poker_hand_type.unwrap();

        match poker_hand_type {
            PokerHandType::Pair | PokerHandType::ThreeOfAKind | PokerHandType::FourOfAKind => {
                Ok(())
            }
            PokerHandType::RoyalFlush
            | PokerHandType::StraightFlush
            | PokerHandType::Flush
            | PokerHandType::Straight
            | PokerHandType::HighCard => {
                Ok(())
            }
            PokerHandType::FullHouse | PokerHandType::TwoPair => {
                Ok(())
            }
        }
    }
```
Our `sort_hand` method returns a Result Enum where the Ok variant returns an empty unit, and the Err variant returns a error string. As previous mentioned, when sorting poker hands, we need to know some information upfront. for our implementation, we need to know the poker hand type and, based on the poker hand type, which card names (ranks) we need to prioritize.

Our first line calls `self.set_hand_type()?` to set our poker hand type. This call returns a Result enum. The `?` after the call allows us to unwrap the enum and, if it is Ok, we return the value and, if it is Err, we use the Err as our return value for the `sort_hand` method.

We then call `self.card_rank_histogram()`. This method gives us a list of the card names (rank) sorted by count (how many times the rank is represented in the list) and name (rank) (a secondary sort where we sort by name/rank in descending order). With regard to importance, this data contains the extra information we need to implement some of the sorting alogrithms we will be using in this method.

Next, we call `self.poker_hand_type.unwrap()` so that we can set the poker hand type value to a local variable for use throughout this method. One thing that we cannot overlook here is the `unwrap` call. Due to Rust Borrowing rules, wrapping an enum typically means that we are taking ownership over the value in the enum. However, we do not want to do that here because, after the `sort_hand` method completes, we do not want `self.poker_hand_type` to be set to None. What we actually want to do is copy the value from `self.poker_hand_type` so that we have a local version of it and `self.poker_hand_type` still owns it.

In order to do this, we must implement Copy for our PokerHandType Enum. Lucky for us, this is a derivable trait. Once you have added it to the list of the other traits we have dereived, your PokerHandType Enum code should look like this:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Ord, PartialOrd, Eq, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]
enum PokerHandType {
    RoyalFlush,
    StraightFlush,
    FourOfAKind,
    FullHouse,
    Flush,
    Straight,
    ThreeOfAKind,
    TwoPair,
    Pair,
    HighCard,
}
```

The bulk of the work done in the `sort_hand` method happens in the match statement. Our match statement is currently broken up into three sections. The first section consist of the poker hand types where sorting them means that we have to prioritize one Card name (rank). The second sections consists of the poker hand types where we have to sort the cards by High Card order and re-arrange them to handle edge cases. The third section consists of the poker hand types where we have to prioritize 2 Card names (ranks) in a particaular order.

```rust,noplayground
    fn sort_hand(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
        let _ = self.set_hand_type()?;
        let card_rank_histogram = self.card_rank_histogram();

        let poker_hand_type = self.poker_hand_type.unwrap();

        match poker_hand_type {
            PokerHandType::Pair | PokerHandType::ThreeOfAKind | PokerHandType::FourOfAKind => {
                let priority_card_name = card_rank_histogram[0].0;

                self.cards.sort_by(|a, b| {
                    if a.name == priority_card_name && b.name == priority_card_name {
                        Ordering::Equal
                    } else if a.name == priority_card_name && b.name != priority_card_name {
                        Ordering::Less
                    } else if a.name != priority_card_name && b.name == priority_card_name {
                        Ordering::Greater
                    } else {
                        a.cmp(&b)
                    }
                });

                Ok(())
            }
            PokerHandType::RoyalFlush
            | PokerHandType::StraightFlush
            | PokerHandType::Flush
            | PokerHandType::Straight
            | PokerHandType::HighCard => {
                Ok(())
            }
            PokerHandType::FullHouse | PokerHandType::TwoPair => {
                Ok(())
            }
        }
    }
```

Filling in the first section, by identifying the card name/rank we want to prioritize. Then we call sort_by on our Vector of cards and pass in a function the priorizes our wanted card name/rank. Once we are done, we return Ok.

```rust,noplayground
    fn sort_hand(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
        let _ = self.set_hand_type()?;
        let card_rank_histogram = self.card_rank_histogram();

        let poker_hand_type = self.poker_hand_type.unwrap();

        match poker_hand_type {
            PokerHandType::Pair | PokerHandType::ThreeOfAKind | PokerHandType::FourOfAKind => {
                let priority_card_name = card_rank_histogram[0].0;

                self.cards.sort_by(|a, b| {
                    if a.name == priority_card_name && b.name == priority_card_name {
                        Ordering::Equal
                    } else if a.name == priority_card_name && b.name != priority_card_name {
                        Ordering::Less
                    } else if a.name != priority_card_name && b.name == priority_card_name {
                        Ordering::Greater
                    } else {
                        a.cmp(&b)
                    }
                });

                Ok(())
            }
            PokerHandType::RoyalFlush
            | PokerHandType::StraightFlush
            | PokerHandType::Flush
            | PokerHandType::Straight
            | PokerHandType::HighCard => {
                self.cards.sort();

                if poker_hand_type == PokerHandType::StraightFlush
                    || poker_hand_type == PokerHandType::Straight
                {
                    // In the case where the straight is Ace, 5, 4 ,3, 2, 1, we need to list
                    // the left by 1 -> 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace
                    if self.cards[0].name == 14 && self.cards[1].name == 5 {
                        self.cards.rotate_left(1);
                    }
                }

                Ok(())
            }
            PokerHandType::FullHouse | PokerHandType::TwoPair => {
                Ok(())
            }
        }
    }
```

Filling in the second section, we start off by sorting the card, which will give a High Card ordering of our cards. Then we need to check for the edge case where we could have <14,5,4,3,2> instead of <5,4,3,2,14>. We do this by using an `if` statement to see if our poker hand type is a Straight or StraightFlush. If so, we then check the first two cards in our sorted list. If they are 14 and 5, we know that we need to move the 14 to the end of the list.

With regard to moving 14 to the end of the list, Vectors have rotate functions. We call `self.cards.rotate_left(1)` which moves everything in the list left by one space. When this happens, the item in the left most position (14), gets moved to the right most position in the list.

After the edge case is handled, we return Ok.

```rust,noplayground
    fn sort_hand(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
        let _ = self.set_hand_type()?;
        let card_rank_histogram = self.card_rank_histogram();

        let poker_hand_type = self.poker_hand_type.unwrap();

        match poker_hand_type {
            PokerHandType::Pair | PokerHandType::ThreeOfAKind | PokerHandType::FourOfAKind => {
                let priority_card_name = card_rank_histogram[0].0;

                self.cards.sort_by(|a, b| {
                    if a.name == priority_card_name && b.name == priority_card_name {
                        Ordering::Equal
                    } else if a.name == priority_card_name && b.name != priority_card_name {
                        Ordering::Less
                    } else if a.name != priority_card_name && b.name == priority_card_name {
                        Ordering::Greater
                    } else {
                        a.cmp(&b)
                    }
                });

                Ok(())
            }
            PokerHandType::RoyalFlush
            | PokerHandType::StraightFlush
            | PokerHandType::Flush
            | PokerHandType::Straight
            | PokerHandType::HighCard => {
                self.cards.sort();

                if poker_hand_type == PokerHandType::StraightFlush
                    || poker_hand_type == PokerHandType::Straight
                {
                    // In the case where the straight is Ace, 5, 4 ,3, 2, 1, we need to list
                    // the left by 1 -> 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace
                    if self.cards[0].name == 14 && self.cards[1].name == 5 {
                        self.cards.rotate_left(1);
                    }
                }

                Ok(())
            }
            PokerHandType::FullHouse | PokerHandType::TwoPair => {
                let priority_1 = card_rank_histogram[0].0;
                let priority_2 = card_rank_histogram[1].0;

                self.cards.sort_by(|a, b| {
                    if a.name == priority_1 && b.name == priority_1 {
                        a.cmp(&b)
                    } else if a.name == priority_1 && b.name == priority_2 {
                        Ordering::Less
                    } else if a.name == priority_2 && b.name == priority_1 {
                        Ordering::Greater
                    } else if a.name == priority_2 && b.name == priority_2 {
                        a.cmp(&b)
                    } else if a.name == priority_1 && b.name != priority_1 && b.name != priority_2 {
                        Ordering::Less
                    } else if a.name == priority_2 && b.name != priority_1 && b.name != priority_2 {
                        Ordering::Less
                    } else if a.name != priority_1 && a.name != priority_2 && b.name == priority_1 {
                        Ordering::Greater
                    } else if a.name != priority_1 && a.name != priority_2 && b.name == priority_2 {
                        Ordering::Greater
                    } else {
                        a.cmp(&b)
                    }
                });

                Ok(())
            }
        }
    }
```

When filling in the final section, we follow the same steps we did in the first section, but we now do it for 2 cards. The code starts with us etting the card names/ranks we are going to prioritize; priority_1 and priority_2. We then call `sort_by` on our Vector of cards and pass it a function that will prioritize priority_1 and priority_2 with respect to each other and all the other cards. This function does have a number of if statments to cover the comparison cases, but you can think of it like this.

When comparing a and b, if a is priority_1, then b can be priority_1, priority_2, or other. If a is priority_2, then b can be priority_1, priority_2, or ther. If a is other, then b can be priority_1, priority_2 or other. Once we handle these 9 cases, can sort our cards with respect to priority_1 and priority_2.
