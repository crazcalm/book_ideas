Thing book is about sorting. I acknowledge that "sorting" means many things to many people. As a Software engineer, I would define sorting as the act of placing a collection of items in order.

For example, if I take the list of [4,3,5,2,1], the sorted order will be [1,2,3,4,5].

If you agree with this definition, I agree with you. If you diasgree with this definition, I also agree with you.

My issue with this definition is that I think it is both correct and misleading. It implies that "sorting" can only result in one definitive order, but what is "order"?

The American Heritage dictionary defines order as "a condition of logical or compreshsible arrangement among the separate elements of a group". This means that as long as the final arrangment of elements is logical or comprehensible, they are ordered.

With that in mind, lists like [1,2,3,4,5] and [5,4,3,2,1] are sorted because both ascending and descending order of numbers are logical arrangments. The same thing can be said for the list [1,3,5,2,4]. It's sorted because the numbers are places in ascending order where the odd numbers are placed in front of the even numbers, which is a logical arrangement.

When it comes to the word order, the important part is the logical arrangement. This can be confusing at times because lists that do not look sorted can actually be sorted if they adhere to a certain order or logical arrangement. For example, the list [3,1,2,4,5] could be unordered, or it could be sorted with numbers arranged in acending order where 3s are given priority and placed at the front of the list.

Throughout this book we will be examining sorting with respect to ordering. We will look at the basic of sorting in Rust, we will learn how to manipulate our sort to achieve a particular order, we will learn how to implement sorting for custom structs, and we will learn how to extend our sorting capabilities at runtime to allow dynamic sorting.
