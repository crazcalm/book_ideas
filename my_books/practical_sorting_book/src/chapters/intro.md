Thing book is about sorting. I acknowledge that "sorting" means many things to many people, which can lead to many differing definitions. 

As a Software engineer, I would define sorting as the act of placing a collection of items in order.

For example, if I take the list of [4,3,5,2,1], the sorted order will be [1,2,3,4,5].

If you agree with this definition, I agree with you. If you diasgree with this definition, I also agree with you.

My issue with this definition is that I think it is both correct and misleading. It implies that "sorting" can only result in one definitive order, but what is "order"?

The American Heritage dictionary defines order as "a condition of logical or compreshsible arrangement among the separate elements of a group". This means that as long as the final arrangment of elements is logical or comprehensible, they are ordered.

With that in mind, [1,2,3,4,5] and [5,4,3,2,1] because ascending and descending order of number is a logical arrangment. What about [1,3,5,2,4], is this ordered? I would say it yes because the numbers are places in ascending order where the odd numbers are placed in front of the even numbers, which is a logical arrangement.

When it comes to order, the focus should be placed on whether or not there is a logical arrangment to your items and not if the items look ordered. For example, [3,1,2,4,5] could be unordered, or it could numbers arranged in acending order where 3 are given priority and placed at the front of the list.

Throughout this book we will be examining sorting with respect to ordering. We will look at the basic of sorting in Rust, we will learn how to manipulate our sort to achieve a particular order, we will learn how to implement sorting for custom structs, and we will learn how to extend our sorting capabilities at runtime to allow dynamic sorting.
