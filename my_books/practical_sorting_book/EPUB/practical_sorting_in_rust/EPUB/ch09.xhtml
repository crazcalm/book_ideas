		  <h2 id="c4_h" class="title">Chapter 9: Implementing our Traits</h2>

		  <p>Lets walk through the work needed to implement the Ord Trait for our Employee Struct so that we can gain a better understanding of what is happening. We will approach this systematically by writing unit tests for the desired order and then implementing each trait one at a time while also removing it from the derived Trait list.</p>

		  <p>For this example, we want our list of Employees to be sorted by years of service and then by name. With that in mind, here is the unit test that we will use to verify that our changes have not affected our sorting.</p>

                name: "Jerry".to_string(),

            Employee {

		  <p>The Ord Trait is a super Trait that requires the Eq Trait and the PartialOrd Trait to be implemented. The Eq Trait is also a Super Trait and it requires PartialEq to be implemented. We'll start by implementing the PartialEq Trait.</p>

		  <p>PartialEq is a Trait that has one required method called <code>eq</code> that allows us to compare one instance of the Struct to another instance of the Struct. This method will return a boolean to denote whether or not these Struct instances are equal. With regards to implementation, we will compare the year of service field and the name field of two Struct instances and return the resulting boolean.</p>

		  <p>In the example, we implemented the PartialEq Trait for Employee and removed that Trait from the derived list. Feel free to run the unit test to make sure everything still works as expected.</p>

		  <p>Next, we will implement the Eq Trait. The Eq Trait has not required methods. This means that as long as you implement PartialEq Trait, you can get the Eq Trait for free by writing implementing it and leaving the code block for it empty.</p>

		  <p>The next Trait we will implement is the PartialOrd Trait. This Trait has one required method called <code>partial_cmp</code> that compares two instance of the smae type and returns an <code>Option&lt;Ordering&gt;</code>. Please note that this method is very similar to the <code>cmp</code> method that comes from the Ord Trait. The difference between these two methods is that <code>cmp</code> returns an Ordering Enum and <code>partial_cmp</code> returns an Option that contains an Ordering Enum.</p>

		    <p>When implementing the the <code>partial_cmp</code> method, we can leverage the fact that each of the field types implement the Ord Trait. As such we can compare the years of service field and the name field using their types <code>cmp</code> method and chain the comparisions with the <code>then</code> method from the Ordering Enum that is returned from the <code>cmp</code> method. We wrap all of this in a <code>Some</code> because we need to return <code>Some&lt;Ordering&gt;</code>. Also, because the Ordering Enum is explicitly being mentioned in our function signature, we will need to make sure to import it at the top of the file.</p>

			  <p>Congratulations! We have implemented the Ord Trait for our Employee Struct.</p>

			  <p>Before we move on, there is something I have to mention about Super Traits. Given the relationships of the dependencies, it is easy to mistakingly assume that the methods of the Sub Traits must be used to implement the Super Traits. This directional ordering does not exist. For example, even though the Ord Trait is a Super Trait that requires the PArtialOrd Trait, we can use the Ord Trait to implement the PartialOrd Trait.</p>

			    <p>In the above example, we took the comparison logic out of the <code>partial_cmp</code> method and put it into the <code>cmp</code> method. Then we called the <code>cmp</code> method within the <code>partial_cmp</code> method. Running our unit tests shows us that this change does not affect our sorting order.</p>
