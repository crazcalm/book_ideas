		  <p>This book is about sorting. I acknowledge that "sorting" means many things to many people. As a Software Engineer, I would define sorting as the acto of placing a collection of items in order.</p>

		  <p>For example, if I take the list of <code>[4, 3, 5, 2, 1]</code>, the sorted order will be <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>.</p>

		  <p>If you agree with this definition, I agree with you. If you disagree with this definition, I also agree with you.</p>

		  <p>My issue with this definition is that it is both correct and misleading. It implies that "sorting" can only result in one definitive order, but what is "order"?</p>

		  <p>The American Heritage dictionary defines order as <q>a condition of logical or comprehensible arrangement among the separate elements of a group</q>. This means that as long as the final arrangment of elements is logical or comprehensible, they are ordered.</p>
