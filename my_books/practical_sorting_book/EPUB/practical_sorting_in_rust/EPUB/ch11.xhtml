		  <h2 id="c4_h" class="title">Chapter 11: Poker - Sorting Strategies</h2>

		  <p>As mentioned, the strategy used to sort our poker hand depends on the type of poker hand we have. For simplicity, we will assume that we have a 5 card hand. With this in mind, we can categories poker hands into the following groups</p>

		  <h3>Sort by Card Rank</h3>
		  <p>High Card and Straight are the only poker hands in this category because they are the only hands judge solely by card rank. Given that our Card struct already sort cards by rank, we can call <code>sort</code> on a hand of cards and get the correct ordering. However, we do need to be aware of the edge case with the Ace. An Ace can be the first or last card in a straight, which means that, for all Straights (Straight and Straight Flush), we need to look at the other cards in the hand and determine whether or not the Ace is suppose to be at the highest or lowest card in the hand.</p>

		  <h3>Sort by Card Rank and Suit</h3>
		  <p>Royal Flush, Straight Flush and Flush can all be sorted by Card Rank while giving priority to a single suit. If you only have 5 cards in your hand like we do, then you can ignore the suit because all 5 cards must have the same suite in order to be a Flush. As a result, we can use the "Sort by Card Rank" to sort these hands. That said, this was given its own category because, when your hand has more than 5 cards, the card suit must be considered.</p>

		  <h3>Sort by Card Rank with Priority to a Single Card Rank</h3>
		  <p>Two Pair, Three Pair and Four of a Kind all prioritize a single Card Rank when sorting. Once all the cards with the prioritized Card Rank are placed in the front of the list, the rest of the cards get sorted by High Card.</p>

		  <h3>Sort by Card Rank while prioritizing 2 Card Ranks (Order Matters)</h3>
		  <p>A Full House is when you have Three of a kind and One Pair in the same hand. To sort this hand, we want to prioritize the Three of a Kind over the One Pair. This means that we have to indentify which card rank is associated with the Three of a Kind and make sure that we prioritize that card rank over the card rank that is associated with the One Pair.</p>

		  <h2>PokerHand</h2>
		  <p>A couple things you may have noticed when listing out the sorting strategies for the poker hands is that most of these strategies depend on extra information. Mainly, we need to know what Poker Hand Type we have and which Card Ranks we need to prioritize. So lets start ourlining our code</p>

		  <p> Our PokerHand Struct needs to hold a hand of cards and it needs to have a place to store its Poker Hand Type.</p>

		  <div class="example">
		    <h5>Example 11.1</h5>
		    <pre>...

#[derive(Debug, Ord, PartialOrd, Eq, PartialEq)]
enum PokerHandType {
    HighCard,
    OnePair,
    TwoPair,
    ThreeOfAKind,
    Straight,
    Flush,
    FullHouse,
    FourOfAKind,
    StraightFlush,
    RoyalFlush,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct PokerHand {
    cards: Vec&lt;Card&gt;,
    poker_hand_type: Option&lt;PokerHandType&gt;,
}

impl PokerHand {
    fn new() -&gt; Self {
        PokerHand {
            cards: Vec::new(),
            poker_hand_type: None,
        }
    }
}

fn main(){
    let mut hand = PokerHand::new();
    println!("{:?}", hand);
}
</pre>
		    <h5>Output 11.1</h5>
		    <pre>PokerHand { cards: [], poker_hand_type: None }</pre>
		  </div>
		  <p>We made the PokerHandType an enum where the variants are the different poker hands types. We also order the poker hand variants from the worst hand to the best hand. We did this so that we can use the derived implementations of the Ord Trait and all the other traits needed to implement the Ord Trait. This is our first time doing this with Enums, but it works the same way as it does with Structs. This means we can now compare and sort the varaints of our PokerHandType enum and, because we defined them in the order of worst hand to best hand, this means that when we compare two poker hands, the hand with the better poker hand type will be greater than the other hand regardless of which cards each hand holds. This also means that when sorting a list of poker hands, hands with a better poker hand type will be placed at the end of the list.</p>

		      <p>For our PokerHand Struct, we have our Vector of Cards and a Optional PokerHandType Enum. The PokerHandType is optional because it needs to be deduced after we have all five Cards in our hand.We also have a function called <code>new</code> responsible for initializing empty PokerHands with no poker hand type. With that in mind, lets create an <code>add_card</code> method to fill our poker hand with cards.</p>

		      <div class="example">
			<h5>Example 11.2</h5>
			<pre>impl PokerHand {

    ...

    fn add_card(&amp;mut self, card: Card) -&gt; Result&lt;(), &amp;'static str&gt; {
        // Our card hand limit is 5.
        if self.cards.len() == 5 {
            return Err("Max hand limit is 5");
        }

        self.cards.push(card);
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut hand = PokerHand::new();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(2, Suit::Heart).unwrap()).unwrap();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(3, Suit::Heart).unwrap()).unwrap();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(4, Suit::Heart).unwrap()).unwrap();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(5, Suit::Heart).unwrap()).unwrap();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(6, Suit::Heart).unwrap()).unwrap();

    assert!(hand.add_card(Card::new(7, Suit::Heart).unwrap()).is_err());

    println!("{:#?}", hand);
}
</pre>
			<h5>Output 11.2</h5>
			<pre>PokerHand {
    cards: [
        Card {
            rank: "2",
            suit: Heart,
        },
        Card {
            rank: "3",
            suit: Heart,
        },
        Card {
            rank: "4",
            suit: Heart,
        },
        Card {
            rank: "5",
            suit: Heart,
        },
        Card {
            rank: "6",
            suit: Heart,
        },
    ],
    poker_hand_type: None,
}</pre>
		      </div>

		  <p>Our <code>add_cards</code> method allows us to add a Card to our PokerHand. This method returns a Result because our PokerHand has a 5 card limit. If we try to add a 6th card, we will raise an error.</p>

		  <p>Now that we have the ability to add cards to our hand, lets move on to deducing our poker_hand_type. We can do this with three helper methods; <code>card_rank_histogram</code>, <code>have_flush</code>, and <code>have_straight</code>.</p>
												<p>The <code>card_rank_histogram</code> method counts how many times each card rank is represented in our hand and returns a histogram in the form of a list of tuples where the tuple is <code>(card_rank as u8, count as usize)</code>. This list will be returned sorted by count and card rank in descending order. This means that if our hand is <code>[2, 9, 2, 2, 2]</code>, we will get <code>[(2, 4), (9, 1)]</code>. The reason this histogram is important is because a number of poker hands are based on how many times a card rank is represented in your hand. For example, FourOfAKind, FullHouse, ThreeOfAKind, TwoPair and OnePair can all be deduced by looking at the first two entries of our histogram list (ie, the top two most represented card ranks in our hand).</p>

		    <p>The <code>have_flush</code> and <code>have_straight</code> methods return a boolean. They are used to deduce all other poker hand types. For example, if you have a flush and a stright, then we must look at your cards because you could have a RoyalFlush, StriaghtFlush or a Flush. If you do not have a Flush, but you have a straight, then you have a Straight. If you do not have a Flush or a Straight, then you have a HighCard hand.</p>

		    <div class="example">
		      <h5>Example: 11.3</h5>
		      
		    
		      <pre>...
use std::collections::HashMap;
...

impl PokerHand {
...

    fn card_rank_histogram(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;(u8, usize)&gt; {
        let mut map = HashMap::new();

        for card in &amp;self.cards {
            map.entry(card.rank)
                .and_modify(|count| *count += 1)
                .or_insert(1);
        }

        let mut results: Vec&lt;(u8, usize)&gt; = map
            .iter()
            .map(|(k, v)| (k.clone(), v.clone() as usize))
            .collect();
        results.sort_by(|a, b| a.1.cmp(&amp;b.1).then(a.0.cmp(&amp;b.0)).reverse());

        results
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut hand = PokerHand::new();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(2, Suit::Heart).unwrap()).unwrap();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(9, Suit::Heart).unwrap()).unwrap();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(2, Suit::Club).unwrap()).unwrap();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(2, Suit::Spade).unwrap()).unwrap();
    hand.add_card(Card::new(2, Suit::Diamond).unwrap()).unwrap();

    assert_eq!(hand.card_rank_histogram(), [(2, 4), (9, 1)]);
    
    println!("{:?}", hand.card_rank_histogram());
}</pre>

			<h5>Output: 11.3</h5>
			<pre>[(2, 4), (9, 1)]</pre>
		      </div>

			  <p>The <code>card_rank_histogram</code> code uses a HashMap to get a count of the card ranks. The HashMap Entry API allows add entries into the HashMap and, if the entry already exists, update its count. The <code>map.entry(card.rank)</code> is the starting point to the Entry API. This call returns an Entry Enum Variant that is either Occupied or Vacant. If the <code>card.rank</code> exists in the HashMap, <code>map.entry</code> will return <code>Entry::Occupied</code>. The <code>Entry::Occupied</code> enum variant has code for the <code>and_modify</code> method that will take the value assciated with this key and pass it to the anonymous function that was passed to the <code>and_modify</code>. We then take this value, which represents our count and add one to it.</p>

			  <p>If <code>card.rank</code> does not exist in the hashmap, <code>map.entry</code> will return <code>Entry::Vacant</code>. The <code>Entry::Vacant</code> enum variant has code for the <code>or_insert(1)</code> method that will add <code>card.rank</code> to the HashMap as a new entry and set the value to 1.</p>

		<p>The confusing part about the Entry API is that it leaverages No-Op (no operation_ calls to work. For example, the <code>or_insert</code> method is called on the <code>Entry::Occupied</code> enum variant, but it has not effect because it is a No-Op call. The same is true for calling the <code>and_modify</code> method on the <code>Entry::Vacant</code> enum variant. So, in order to understand what the code is doing, you have to think about that happens in both cases. If it is the first time the HashMap has seen this card rank, we give it a count of 1. If it is not the first time we have seen this card rank, we take its current count and add 1 to it.</p>


			  <p>The next part of the code uses iterators to convert the HashMap into a Vector of Tuples. We do this via the <code>map</code> method, which give us access to the key values of the HashMap as a tuple. Not wanting to take ownership of these values, we clone and cast them them as needed to get the type we want. We then use the <code>collect</code> method to create our <code>Vec&lt;(u8, usize)&gt;</code>. The <code>collect</code> method knows what type to create because we explicitly state the wanted type when declaring our variable (<code>let mut results: Vec&lt;(u8, usize)&gt; = ...</code>).</p>

		  <p>Once we have our list, we sort it by the count (tuple index 1) and then card rank (tuple index 0). Calling <code>reverse</code> on the end of the compare chain ensures that the largest values will be at the beginning of the list, which gives us descending order.</p>

		  <p>The next method we will create is our <code>have_flush</code> method which is responsible for detecting whether or not our poker hand contains a flush.</p>

			<p>The <code>have_flush</code> code is straight forward in the sense that we look at the suite of the first card in the list and then check to see if the rest of the cards in the list have the same suite.

As a result, we had to derive the <code>PartialEq</code> trait for our <code>Suit</code> enum.</p>

			<p>The next next method we will create is the <code>have_straight</code> method which is responsible for detecting whether or not our poker hand contains a straight. When implementing this method, we have to be careful to account for the cases where the ace is in the front and end of the straight.</p>

		  <p>The <code>have_straight</code> method starts off by creating a mutable list of card ranks. We do this so that we can sort them because, in theory, to have a straight means that your first rank in the list is your starting point and every rank after it should be +1 of the prevous rank. The exception to this rule is when your striaght starts at the Ace (<code>[A, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>). In that case, your sorted list would be <code>[2, 3, 4, 5, 14]</code>. In the code, we explicitly check for this case to make sure it gets handle and, for all other cases, we use our "in thoery" logic to check if the hand has a straight.</p>

		<p>Now that we have all of the helper methods done, we can write the code to deduce and set our poker hand type.</p>

			<p>The <code>set_hand_type</code> method first checks to see if we have 5 cards in our hand. The is a mandatory step because our code was written the the assumption of our hands only having 5 cards. If we have more or less than 5 cards, the code will not work as expected. Next, we set <code>self.poker_hand_type</code> to None. This is important because we will use this value to check to see if we should return early. For example, if <code>self.poker_hand_type</code> is set to <code>Some</code>, then we know that we have deduced our poker hand type and we have no need to run any more checks. After that, we call our <code>card_rank_histogram</code> method to obtain the count of the card ranks which are ordered by count and then rank in descending order so that the largest values appear first in the tuple. Knowing this, we use the card rank histogram to check the cases for FourOfAKind, FullHouse, ThreeOfAKind, TwoPair and OnePair. If any of these cases are true, we set <code>self.poker_hand_type</code> to the appropriate poker hand type.</p>

			<p>At this point, we check to see if <code>self.poker_hand_type</code> is set. If so, we return early. If not, it means that we still need to check the other cases. The other cases are flushes and straights cases. We use a match statement to list out the cases of <code>have_flush</code> and <code>have_straight</code>. For each case, we set <code>self.poker_hand_type</code> appropriately. By this point, we have checked all of the possible poker hand cases. In thoery, <code>self.poker_hand_type</code> should be set by now. However, there is always the possbility that some part of our code is not correct. As such, we end the methodby checking to see if <code>self.poker_hand_type</code> was set. If it was set, we return an Ok. If it was not set, we return an error.</p>
